## Explaination
**split_dataset/cluster** collected scripts of Pocket Pfam-based clustering (Pfam-cluster) and Protein sequence-based clustering (Seq-cluster).
**split_dataset/3_fold** contained the training, validation and testing dataset for generalization ability benchmark in the paper.
**models/Descriptor_based_model**  contained source code of LR::V, LR::VR1, RF-Score, XGB::VR1 and NNScore. Other evaluated models were downloaded from individial paper.
**models/shap** is the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis on RF-Score
**plot_scripts** Ploting scripts for figures
